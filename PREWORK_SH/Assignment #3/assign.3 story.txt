Assignment #3: My Greatest Challenge

9. Plan Often...

After reading this module I would target my ability to fully break down the problem and plan my process out beforehand as being a challenge I would like to attack. Breaking down a complex task into smaller, managable, parts is sometimes difficult when I would rather just dive in and start 'trial and erroring' my way through. I know from past CS classes that this part of the process is absolutely vital and will always save immeasurable amounts of time in the long run. This is a skill that I want to grow simply because it is crucial for programming but it is also very helpful in every day life when tackling difficult goals making long term plans. 

My plan is to remember the value of fully planning out my steps i'm going to take to tackle the problem and when I'm banging my head against a wall, to go back, and make sure I have fully understood the problem and broken the problem down correctly before I continue spiraling down the 'I'm stuck for hours randomly trying random things to see if something randomly works' rabbit hole.
