    <div class="bio">
        <p>Beginning his career with 2002's definitive To Let, Xavier Rudd put his message out into the world and was answered immediately. 
            Fans from all over the globe were drawn to the distinctly Australian-looking musician, activist and surfer. It was the start of a journey that would span well over 15 years (and counting);
                taking Xavier to almost every continent on the planet, where he has connected with people from all cultures and walks of life. There are no borders that apply to Xavier Rudd's music. 
            His earliest live format was a wonderful spectacle, placing Xavier inside a forest of yidakis (didgeridoos) from which he dexterously crafted layers of guitar, percussion, blues harp and vocals.
            He was distinct, unique and unforgettable. Since then he has played in a variety of solo and band formats, each with an unmistakable personality of its own.
            The further the ripples of his career reached, the bigger the wave got. Australia was the first to fall in love with Xavier. Then it was Europe. Then it was North America. The snowball kept rolling.
