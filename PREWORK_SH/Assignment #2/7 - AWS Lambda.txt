Lambda is serverless or 'cloud-based'. Which means it basically creates a virtual server,upon being triggered, for your application and that server then vanishes, or 'spins down', when it is finished being used. This also means we don't have to manage a server ourselves and because the Lambda service is a computing service the resources required to handle whatever code you are executing will automatically be managed through Amazon Web Services.
