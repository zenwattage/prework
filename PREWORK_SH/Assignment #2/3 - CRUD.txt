CRUD stands for Create Read Update Delete. Sometimes called CRUDL, the 'L' is for, listing, of large data sets.

CRUD is referring to all of the major functions that are implemented in a relational database application.

Also can be described as all the functions involved in a user interface that helps viewing, searching, and changing information.

Another way to view CRUD is:

When building an API model - the four basic types of functionality that the model must possess are: CRUD.

Overall it seems that CRUD is basically a methodology or paradigm that helps developers create a usable model for web applications, storage databases, etc. It's a term used in CS that refers to the required functionality that a usable API model must contain.  

All of that being said, in a REST (see module 2 - REST(ful)) environment, CRUD refers to the fundamental elements of a persistant storage system, which is controlled with HTTP methods. Which means CRUD becomes, POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE.
